            <h3>Prime Focus Telescope</h3>
            <p class="project__description">
              This project was started to produce a (mostly) 3D printable prime-focus telescope for 
personal use, but evolved into an open-source project, published on Thingiverse with a bill of 
external materials and build instructions. The telescope is a prime focus Newtonian style 
reflector with an f8 mirror. It features a CMOS camera in place of a traditional eye piece, 
allowing for digital viewing and live capture for astrophotography. The telescope was design
with simplicity and modularity in mind, featuring few pieces and a designed that supports 
optical flexibility. The main body is connected to top collector via steel tubing, held in place by a 
friction lock system, allowing the physical focal to be adjusted to any desired length. This 
combined with a modular mirror tray system allows the telescope to switch between planetary 
and deep space optical requirements. The telescope also features a simple collimator and a fine
focus mechanism. This project was a great exercise in tolerance design (3D printed parts mating
with each other and other components), overall design consideration (thinking about ease of 
construction and use), and design iteration (ex. first/proof of concept light collector was made 
from an old stripped-down web camera). To date, the project files have been downloaded 
2,243 times. The full project link can be found below.

            <h3>Aircraft Construction</h3>
            <p class="project__description">
              An ongoing project is the scratch construction of a Steen Skybolt Biplane by my father 
and I. This project has provided me invaluable hands on aerospace experience, and helped me
develop woodworking and metal working skills such as oxy acetylene welding. Given only a set 
of plans, the greatest challenge of this project is developing the best construction method for 
each part, taking into account required tolerances and ease of construction. This means designing and creating complex, 
custom jigs to produce parts within acceptable tolerances, while maintaining realistic project time and monetary constraints.

            <h3>Smartwatch Development</h3>
            <p class="project__description">
              This project was an attempt at developing a personal smartwatch from 
scratch, delvoping both hardware and software. After considering project constraints and required features, I choose a chipset based on 
documentation, availability, and onboard graphics function. Using the chip documentation, I 
drew up a connection schematic then created it in EAGLE. The boards were then custom 
ordered and manufactured. Once the boards and components were received, I populated the 
boards an attempted basic interaction. Initial multimeter and flashing tests yielded promising 
results, however component availability, obsolescence, and first iteration design flaws have 
slowed development. I learned much from this attempt and look forward to more functional
future iterations.

            <h3>Handheld Game Console</h3>
            <p class="project__description">
              This project was started to create a fully mobile enclosure for a raspberry pi based 
Retropi console. Given a raspberry pi flashed with the software, the task was to curate
necessary peripheral components (such as controls, screen, and power) and then design an
enclosure to house everything in an acceptable form factor. The component choices were 
made, in conjunction with on-hand components, with minimum performance requirements and 
maximum available space as lower and upper constraints respectively (ex. the battery is an old 
power bank and the controls are a dissected SNES controller). Once the system was finalized, a 
shell was designed to cater to user ergonomics, ease of manufacturing (optimized for 3D 
printing), and ease of assembly and maintenance. This project was a great exercise in full
system design and integration, as well as a good exercise in efficient part design given multiple
considerations.

            <h3>RC Aircraft Experimentation</h3>
            <p class="project__description">
              I have always been fascinated by RC aircraft, as it was the closest thing to flying I had 
before I was able to start my flight training. While I have had traditional model aircraft, most
aircraft I flew (or attempted to fly) were strange and experimental personal designs ranging 
from canard biplanes to ornithopters. Most were iterative processes focusing on the 
development of a particular characteristic, whether it be aerodynamic, structural, or 
performance based. Most aircraft, with the exception of 3D printing experimentation, were 
built with foam core for rapid prototyping and durability. This design process greatly helped my 
understanding of basic flight dynamics and principles, as well as giving me practice in rapid 
prototyping and testing.
